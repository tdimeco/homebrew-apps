# Homebrew Tap for personal apps

## How do I install these formulae?

`brew install tdimeco/apps/<formula/cask>`

Or `brew tap tdimeco/apps` and then `brew install <formula/cask>`.

Or, in a [`brew bundle`](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-bundle) `Brewfile`:

```ruby
tap "tdimeco/apps"
brew "<formula>"
cask "<cask>"
```
